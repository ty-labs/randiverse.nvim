# randiverse.nvim üí•

Tired of raking your brain trying to generate 'random' text for sample/test cases (and secretly leaking your life details üòÜ)? Randiverse--the "Random Universe"--is a flexible, integrated nvim plugin that can generate random text for a variety of scenarios including _ints_, _floats_, _names_, _dates_, _lorem ipsum_, _emails_, and more! Created by a recent VScode --> NVIM convert and inspired by the simple, albeit handy, "Random Everything" VScode extension.
