Randiverse‚Äîthe "Random Universe"‚Äîis a flexible, integrated nvim plugin that can generate random text for a variety of scenarios including ints, floats, names, dates, lorem ipsum, emails, and more! Created by a recent VScode --> NVIM convert and inspired by the simple, albeit handy, "Random Everything" VScode extension.
